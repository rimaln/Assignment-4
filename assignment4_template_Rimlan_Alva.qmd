## Data and Documenting

### What's in this section

1.  Can we recommend high-quality books based on community preferences? 
 In particular, I aim to explore how average ratings, rating count, genre, and authorship influence what books we might recommend. I chose this because I'm an avid reader and have always wanted to see if a data-driven approach could suggest books I might love but haven’t discovered.
 
2. For this project, I’m using a Goodreads dataset that includes detailed metadata on thousands of books—such as titles, authors, average ratings, rating counts, publishers, and publication dates. Originally scraped and shared on Kaggle, it was curated to support book recommendation systems, making it well-suited for analyzing reader preferences and identifying top-rated books.

This dataset is highly suitable for my task for several reasons:

- **Rich in Numeric and Categorical Variables:**
It includes average ratings (1–5 scale), number of ratings, and publication details — which are essential for ranking and filtering books.

- **Well-Structured:**
The dataset is clean and consolidated into a single file, with minimal preprocessing needed compared to many other book datasets.

- **Supports Recommendation Use Cases:**
With user rating aggregates and author/book metadata, I can analyze trends, identify top books in each genre or by rating, and simulate a basic recommendation approach.

- **Ethically Acceptable:**
The dataset contains no personal user data — only aggregated ratings and book details — making it appropriate for educational and analytical use.

- **Aligned with My Question:**
Since my question revolves around identifying and recommending highly-rated books, this dataset provides exactly the type of information I need to evaluate book popularity and reader preferences.

3. *Data Type*
- The dataset is **observational sample data**, compiled through web scraping of publicly available book information on Goodreads.
- It is **not experimental**; rather, it is an aggregate of user ratings and book details collected over time.
- It can be considered a **sample** of books from Goodreads rather than a complete census of all published books.

- *Data Dictionary*

| Variable Name      | Description                              | Data Type          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `title`            | Title of the book                        | Categorical (text) |
| `author`           | Name of the author                       | Categorical (text) |
| `average_rating`   | Average user rating (scale 1 to 5)       | Numeric (float)     |
| `ratings_count`    | Number of user ratings                    | Numeric (integer)   |
| `publisher`        | Publisher of the book                    | Categorical (text) |
| `publication_date` | Date when the book was published         | Date / Categorical  |
| `genre`            | Genre or category of the book (if present) | Categorical (text) |

*Data Limitations*

- The dataset reflects **only books listed and rated on Goodreads**, which may introduce bias toward more popular or English-language titles.
- The ratings are **aggregated user ratings**, which may be subject to biases such as popularity bias or rating inflation.
- Some fields, such as genre or publication date, may have **missing or inconsistent values**.
- The dataset may not fully represent all book markets or reader demographics worldwide.

*Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations*

- The dataset contains **no personally identifiable information (PII)** or individual user data; only aggregated ratings and book metadata are included.
- Use of this dataset is **ethically appropriate for educational and analytical purposes**.
- Since the data is publicly available and anonymized, there are no privacy risks associated with its use.
- I acknowledge the importance of using data responsibly and transparently, avoiding misrepresentation or over-generalization based on this sample.
